                            <span class="quicksand-normal-semibold">my path to ui/ux designing wasn't a straight line, but every step prepared me for it.</span> while i was in cégep studying pure and applied sciences, i took a web design class as a complementary course. it was my first taste of html and css, and i loved it—i liked the fact that i was able to express my creativity and build something of my own.

                        <p class="quicksand-normal-regular">
                            during that time i was still trying to figure out which career i wanted to do. i was hesitating between two technical programs: computer science and biomedical laboratory technology. i ended up choosing the health field.

                        <p class="quicksand-normal-regular">
                            after finishing my degree in 2021, i decided to do a bachelor's degree in microbiology as i was working as a medical technologist at the hospital. it was during a saturday shift, in the middle of the day that i realized that this isn't for me. even though my work as a medical technologist is crucial to hospitals, i decided to do a career change and pursue my goal of becoming a front-end developer.

                        <p class="quicksand-normal-regular">
                            it was during my second year, in human-machine interface class, that everything clicked. i was fascinated by the psychology behind the user experience and the magic of transforming complex problems into simple, intuitive, and beautiful solutions.

                            today, i am wrapping up my bachelor's degree in computer science and i am ready to dive into the world of ui/ux designing.

                            outside of work and school, i find joy in a variety of activities that keep my mind active and my hands busy. you can find me rock climbing, doing puzzles, or learning the art of pottery. these hobies, along with my love for traveling, help me stay creative and open to new ideas.
