                    the core goal of this project was to transform the existing, text-heavy exo inspector informational page into a high-conversion landing page to support a recruitment campaign. by simplifying the page's structure and adding prominent calls-to-action (CTAs) for job applications and event surveys, i successfully converted static content into a dynamic recruiting hub.
